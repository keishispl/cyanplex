    <h2 style="color: white;">A base introduction</h2>
    <h3 style="color: rgba(200, 200, 200)">Alright. We don't want to make you confused as we go along the code, so we'll go step by step instead of cramping everything here at once.<br>Here's the whole code for reference if you can read it:</h3>
    <div class="code"><pre>
command clone &lt;world&gt;:
    permission: op
    trigger:
        send "&3&lMAINTENENCE &8» &fMaintenence is starting in world &6%arg-1% &fin &620 seconds&f." to all players
        wait 15 seconds
        send "&3&lMAINTENENCE &8» &fMaintenence is starting in world &6%arg-1% &fin &65 seconds&f." to all players
        wait 5 seconds
        player command "citizens save"
        set {maintenence::%arg-1%} to true
        send "&3&lMAINTENENCE &8» &fMaintenence is starting in world &6%arg-1%&f..." to all players
        teleport all players in world "%arg-1%" to spawn of world "maintenence"
        player command "mv delete %arg-1%"
        player command "mv confirm"
        player command "mv clone %arg-1%build %arg-1%"
        wait 5 seconds
        teleport all players in world "maintenence" to spawn of world "%arg-1%"
        player command "citizens reload"
        player command "citizens reload"
        player command "holo reload"
        delete {maintenence::%arg-1%}
        send "&3&lMAINTENENCE &8» &fMaintenence in world &6%arg-1% &fis &acompleted&f." to all players
    </pre></div>
    <h2 style="color: white;">Part 1: Command</h2>
    <h3 style="color: rgba(200, 200, 200)">Mhm.. Our worlds are made from cloning from other worlds that we've already finished building in.<br>Anyways, the code below is a command, named <code>clone</code>, which will require a variable when using the command: a world name.<br>And needing to be a operator to use the command too! The trigger is for what happens when using the command.</h3>
    <div class="code"><pre>
command clone &lt;world&gt;:
    permission: op
    trigger:</pre></div>
    <h2 style="color: white;">Part 2: Preparing</h2>
    <h3 style="color: rgba(200, 200, 200)">When we clone a world, we would want to teleport players to another world before cloning, right?<br>Of course, we can't just teleport them instantly cuz that might freak them out and they might lose progress from this,<br>so we will create a warning message before it actually happens.</h3>
    <div class="code"><pre>
send "&3&lMAINTENENCE &8» &fMaintenence is starting in world &6%arg-1% &fin &620 seconds&f." to all players
wait 15 seconds
send "&3&lMAINTENENCE &8» &fMaintenence is starting in world &6%arg-1% &fin &65 seconds&f." to all players
wait 5 seconds
player command "citizens save"
set {maintenence::%arg-1%} to true
send "&3&lMAINTENENCE &8» &fMaintenence is starting in world &6%arg-1%&f..." to all players
teleport all players in world "%arg-1%" to spawn of world "maintenence"</pre></div>
    <h3 style="color: rgba(200, 200, 200)">Oh yes, we will create a warning time of 20 seconds, when the time is up, we'd make the admin do "citizens save" which will save the shops data.<br>Then we will set the cloning variable to true, as, we are cloning that world. And we will teleport the players to a dimension.</h3>
    <h2 style="color: white;">Part 3: Cloning</h2>
    <h3 style="color: rgba(200, 200, 200)">OK, we are now actually cloning the worlds now.<br>First off, we will delete the world first because it cnnnot clone a world into the same name. Then, we would actually clone the world.</h3>
    <div class="code"><pre>
player command "mv delete %arg-1%"
player command "mv confirm"
player command "mv clone %arg-1%build %arg-1%"
wait 5 seconds</pre></div>
    <h3 style="color: rgba(200, 200, 200)">Oh yes, we would also wait 5 seconds as cloning might take some time.</h3>
    <h2 style="color: white">Part 4: Aftermath</h2>
    <h3 style="color: rgba(200, 200, 200)">OK so we will now do the stuff to restore the shops and holograms.<br>First, we will teleport the players back.</h3>
    <div class="code"><pre>
teleport all players in world "maintenence" to spawn of world "%arg-1%"
player command "citizens reload"
player command "citizens reload"
player command "holo reload"
delete {maintenence::%arg-1%}
send "&3&lMAINTENENCE &8» &fMaintenence in world &6%arg-1% &fis &acompleted&f." to all players</pre></div>
    <h3 style="color: rgba(200, 200, 200)">After that, we will reload the shops and holograms, then delete the variable as we finished the cloning.<br>At last, we will send a little message saying that cloning the world is now over.</h3>
    <h2 style="color: white">Why is this Skript important to us?</h2>
    <h3 style="color: rgba(200, 200, 200)">Well, because I hate to manually do things, and well, this is useful in cloning an new area of the dimension into an existing dimension.<br>Because we wouldn't want to build right where people can already see them, as it would just remove the element of suprise of what it actually looks like.<br>(And we don't want them to break our builds yet, or annoying us.)<br><br>Oh yeah, we use a coding language called <a href="https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript">Skript</a>, which is easy to learn. You can try it too if you want.<br>Anyways, see you in the next Developer blog!</h3>
