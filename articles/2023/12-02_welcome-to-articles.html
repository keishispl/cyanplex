    <h2 style="color: white;">Where were you?</h2>
    <h3 style="color: rgba(200, 200, 200)">I've been busy making this for a while now, this is a new section, for all the news, events, developer behind-the-scenes, to be documented in.<br>I seriously hope that this section will come alive as more and more stuff happens with the server!<br>(You know, sometimes CSS could be frustrating.)</h3>
    <h2 style="color: white;">CyanPlex Website</h2>
    <h3 style="color: rgba(200, 200, 200)">About the website... Nothing much has been going on. I just worked on this for a while now, like I said before.<br>But not only this has been keeping me busy though, you could also check out the updates section of the website! It's really cool! (Based on my opinion)<br>I still think this section is the best looking so far though, so nothing can beat it.</h3>
    <h2 style="color: white;">December</h2>
    <h3 style="color: rgba(200, 200, 200)">As December arrives, I can make more things both for the website and the server! Because there would be school holidays.<br>I plan to finish making the overworld dimension with the shops for stone, coal, gold and iron then continue and make a new dimension - the Nether.<br>After that, I would plan to make even more dimensions! And finish making how prestiging works. And more abilities!</h3>
    <h2 style="color: white;">Plans for the Website</h2>
    <h3 style="color: rgba(200, 200, 200)">I won't expect myself to work on the website for a while now, although many things are not done yet.<br>I still hope that I could finish the website before continuing creating the server but I guess not.<br>I might not work on the website for a while, but I would still keep you all updated with changelogs and articles about the new features!</h3>
